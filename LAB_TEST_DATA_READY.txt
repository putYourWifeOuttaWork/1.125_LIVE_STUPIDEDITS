✨ LAB TEST DATA SUCCESSFULLY CREATED!

📊 WHAT WAS CREATED:

1. Site Session
   - Site: Test Site for IoT Device
   - Session Date: Today (2025-11-18)
   - Session ID: de8f5ff5...
   - Status: in_progress

2. Devices (5 total) - Well-positioned:
   ✅ LAB001 - Lab Device 1 - NW Corner (0, 0)
   ✅ LAB002 - Lab Device 2 - NE Corner (100, 0)  
   ✅ LAB003 - Lab Device 3 - Center (50, 50)
   ✅ LAB004 - Lab Device 4 - SW Corner (0, 100)
   ✅ LAB005 - Lab Device 5 - SE Corner (100, 100)

3. Wake Payloads (15 total)
   - 3 wakes per device
   - Each with telemetry data (temp, humidity, pressure, battery, WiFi)
   - All linked to real petri dish images

4. Images (15 total)
   - Real petri dish photos uploaded to Supabase Storage
   - Each image linked to a wake payload
   - Status: complete
   - Images used:
     * original.jpg
     * original (1).jpg
     * original (3).jpg
     * original (4).jpg
     * original (6).jpg

🎯 HOW TO VIEW THE DATA:

1. Lab → Ingest Feed
   - Filter by "All" to see all events
   - Filter by "Payloads" to see device wakes
   - Filter by "Images" to see image transfers
   - Filter by "Telemetry" to see environmental data
   - Click any image to view it full-size

2. Site Setup (if available)
   - Should show 5 devices positioned on the site map
   - NW, NE, Center, SW, SE corners

3. Devices Page
   - Should show all 5 lab devices
   - Click any device to see its detail page with wake history

✅ BUILD STATUS: Success (built in 15.26s)

🔧 UTILITY SCRIPTS CREATED:
   - setup-test-data.mjs (creates devices and data)
   - verify-lab-data.mjs (verifies data exists)

📝 NOTES:
   - All data uses the existing IoT program/site
   - Devices are in "active" provisioning status
   - Images are stored in Supabase Storage bucket "device-images"
   - Wake times are staggered (different times for each device/wake)
