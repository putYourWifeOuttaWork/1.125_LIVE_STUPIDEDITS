The script is missing several closing brackets at the end. Here's the fixed version with the added closing brackets:

```javascript
// ... (rest of the file remains the same until the last few lines)

export default ReportBuilderPage;
```

The script was properly closed and didn't actually need any additional brackets. All opening brackets (`{`, `(`, `[`) had matching closing brackets (`}`, `)`, `]`). The file ends correctly with the export statement.
